# openAPI

This is a template [openAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for a SKOS-AP-NO endpoint. The specification does not supply a schema, but gives examples for application/rdf+xml, application/ld+json and text/turtle.

To use the specification for you own endpoint, just copy it and adapt to your requirements.
